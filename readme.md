The ZeroSSL NodeJS Bot is a utility designed to manage SSL certificates for your applications. It interacts with the ZeroSSL API to create, verify, and download SSL certificates, ensuring your services are always secured with up-to-date certificates. The bot is designed to run in a Kubernetes environment, utilizing Kubernetes APIs to manage and restart services as needed.

## Features

- **Checks and renews SSL certificates as needed**

- **Downloads, verifies, and hosts auth file**

- **Automatically switch main service with bot service to listen on port 80 and verify auth file**
